title: Kubernetes Contributors 
description: Welcome to the Kubernetes community!
---

This site is the home of contributor documentation, and serves as a starting point for your journey as a Kubernetes contributor.

This site is to serve as the hub for all things related to the Kubernetes Contributor experience. Who exactly is a contributor? We all are--Whether you’re writing docs, reviewing code, participating in the community and its many SIGs, everyone is welcome. We hope this site will be a pathway to success for our 35000+ Kubernetes contributors, providing current, up-to-date information on community events, contributor resources, Kubernetes SIGs, and more.

### Get Involved:

The first step is to check out the contributor guide. [link to contributor site path].
